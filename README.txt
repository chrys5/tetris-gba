Janky tetris. Controls are listed on the main screen.

This is an attempted replica of tetris, where the pieces would (theoretically) get faster as more lines are cleared.

There are several visual glitches and bugs that I was not able to resolve before the deadline. I was also planning
on making a piece-holding mechanism.

The GT logo appears after 5 lines are cleared.

I implemented most of the game in the gameplay.c file, which contains the essential functions for each tetromino. 
I also used several states to create a starting animation for the home screen. If there are too many inputs in a 
short amount of time, the game may bug out. I tried my best :,)
